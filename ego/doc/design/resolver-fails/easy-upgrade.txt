# These old versions of toolchain packages (binutils, gcc, glibc) are no
# longer officially supported and are not suitable for general use. Using
# these packages can result in build failures (and possible breakage) for
# many packages, and may leave your system vulnerable to known security
# exploits.
#
# If you still use one of these old toolchain packages, please upgrade (and
# in case of gcc switch the compiler) ASAP. If you need them for a specific
# (isolated) use case, feel free to unmask them on your system.

- sys-libs/glibc-2.20-r1::gentoo (masked by: package.mask)
